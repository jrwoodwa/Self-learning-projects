# Markov Decision Process Model - Chapter 19.3
This project is based on Chapter 19.3 of *"Introduction to Operations Research"* by F. Hillier and G. Lieberman (10th Edition), specifically pages 877-887. It demonstrates a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation and optimization using Pyomo.

## Contents:
Problem Formulation: Defines the states, decisions, and cost matrix.
Transition Matrix: Defines transitions between states under different policies.
Optimization Model: Uses Pyomo to solve the MDP and find the optimal policy.
Sections:
Chapter 19.1-19.2: Problem definition and model setup.
Chapter 19.3: Linear programming and mathematical optimization approach.

## Installation:
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
pip install numpy pyomo
